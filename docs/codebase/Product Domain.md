# Product Domain

**Safarnama / TripCompare** — a marketplace for curated group trips in India (Pune-first launch). Organizers who currently run their businesses on WhatsApp + UPI + Google Sheets get a storefront; travelers get discovery, comparison, and ==payment protection==.

## Differentiators

- **SafePay escrow** — funds held at the gateway (Razorpay Route `on_hold` transfers / Cashfree Easy Split scheduling) and released to the organizer only after trip completion, with a ==90-day safety buffer==. See [[Payments & Webhooks]].
- **Anti-leakage chat filter** — blocks phone/UPI/email/URL sharing in chat to keep transactions on-platform (`apps/api/src/utils/chat-filter.ts`).
- **In-app wallet** — refunds, cashback (default 5%), booking deductions, promotional credits with ==90-day expiry==.
- **Trip comparison** — side-by-side compare of up to **3** trips.
- **Dual booking modes** — `INSTANT` and `REQUEST_BASED` (organizer approves, approval expires in 48h).
- **Visual seat maps** — organizer builds vehicle layouts; travelers pick seats (10-minute holds).
- **Real-time chat** — Socket.IO trip chat + admin support conversations.

## Business Model

Free to list for organizers (zero upfront cost, no lock-in). Platform takes ==10% commission== (`PLATFORM_COMMISSION_PERCENT`, per-organizer override via `OrganizerProfile.commissionRate`) on protected payments; cashback drives retention.
